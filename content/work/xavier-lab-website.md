For them, there was no reason that a lab website couldn’t be fun and modern. Using examples they sent me and research on the latest web design trends, I created a responsive websitewith contemporary aesthetics.

I went with a WordPress CMS for easy editing and used a free WordPress theme as a design base. I customized the admin dashboard and installed an array of customized plugins so updating content-heavy pages would be easy.
