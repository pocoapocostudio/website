Authors Jon Follett and Matthew Holm contacted me to create a trailer for their latest book. The project time frame was short--the book release was only two weeks away.

Using black-and-white illustrations created for the book by Matthew, I created a “creature feature” style trailer inspired by genre classics like Tarantula, The Day the Earth Stood Still, and other giant monster movies.

<strong>Designing for Emerging Technologies</strong>

Designing for Emerging Technologies explores areas of fast-moving technology in desperate need of user experience design — from the IoT to robotics, 3D printing to wearables, neuroscience to synthetic biology, genomics and more. I created a book trailer for the book’s editor, Jon Follett, who asked for a video with a similar aesthetic to his Disrupt! feature article.
