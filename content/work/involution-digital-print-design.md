Involution Studios, a UX design agency working in the healthcare space, was founded in 2004 in Palo Alto, CA. I worked with Involution for two years creating marketing assets.

**Handout Booklet**

For marketing purposes, Involution needed a print version of its case studies already on its website. I designed a square booklet layout, creating an aesthetic which conformed to Involutionâ€™s branding.

Involution Studios then needed to create a design pattern applicable to all its marketing materials. Building off the handout booklet shown above, I designed a modular system appropriate for many marketing contexts.
