If you're reading this, you've caught me at a weird time. I'm transforming my freelance business, previously named Brian Liston Video Production & Digital Design, into Poco a Poco Studio, a small design shop focused on web development.

There are a couple reasons for this change. I've decided to pursue what I enjoy doing most, web development, and I'm aiming to bring other designers and developers on to some of my web projects.

I'm really privileged to have had experience in a variety of creative roles, such as print designer, video editor and animator. Freelancing gives me the flexibility to pick up whatever kind of projects I want to work on. One day I can be shooting photos of a conference for grade school science teachers, another day I can be editing audio for a podcast. For an autodidact like myself, this is a great arrangement. I feel like my work was always challenging. Working on so many different projects requires me to learn continuously and expand my creative abilities.

However, I feel like the time has come to choose one craft. I want to master something, not be adequate at a few different things. It was a difficult decision, but I've finally chosen web development. Since I'm self-taught, I've always felt like a little bit of an imposter around other devs. I've also felt a little hesitant to give up video and visual design. And, I've worried that focusing on just one sort of creative work will be boring.

These concerns dissipated once I realized how endlessly complex the field of web development is. I know it will keep me challenged. Web developers with solid design skills are rare, and web developers with time-based media skills are even more rare (and useful--after all, user experiences are time-based). There's so much to learn and explore. This change of focus is partly why I've chosen to rebrand to Poco a Poco Studio.

Another reason is that I'd also like to work with other developers and designers on my client projects. For instance, I've been talking to a potential client who needs a lot of changes made to the backend of their web application. Unfortunately, the application is written in a programming language I'm not familiar with. I need some specialized help with this project, but it's a little awkward to bring another developer on board under the name Brian Liston Video Production & Digital Design. Could I even put the work in my portfolio if I didn't make all of it? I've had to do that before, but it has felt strange to me. No matter how specific I get about my role on a project in a certain case study, it's still posted on brianliston.com.

Rebranding to Poco a Poco Studio solves these problems. It allows me to collaborate with a variety of people on bigger projects, and it gives me more direction in my work. I'll be making the transition to Poco a Poco in plain view. Over the next few weeks I'll be posting occasional updates on this blog about the transition process and the vision I have for my studio. More to come!
